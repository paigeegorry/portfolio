      <p>
        I love solving puzzles! When I am not coding, you will find me playing puzzle video games (like Portal 2). 
        Debugging is one of my favorite things because of the excitement when you solve it. 
        I have a huge thirst for learning new things and the ever-changing world of coding gives me ample opportunity
        to learn something new all the time.
